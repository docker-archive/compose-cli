This CLI tool makes it easy to run Docker containers and Docker Compose applications in the cloud using either Amazon
Elastic Container Service
([ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs))
or Microsoft Azure Container Instances
([ACI](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances))
using the Docker commands you already know.

To get started, all you need is:
* An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)
  account
* Windows: The Stable or Edge release of
  [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows)
* macOS: The Stable or Edge release of
  [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
