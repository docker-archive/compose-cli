# Architecture

ECS integration relies on CloudFormation to manage AWS resources as an atomic operation.
This document describes the mapping between compose application model and AWS components

## Overview

This diagram shows compose model and on same line AWS components that get created as equivalent resources

Each compose application service is mapped to an ECS `Service`. A `TaskDefinition` is created according to compose definition.
Actual mapping is constrained by both Cloud platform and Fargate limitations. Such a `TaskDefinition` is set with a single container,
according to the compose model which doesn't offer a syntax to support sidecar containers.

An IAM Role is created and configured as `TaskRole` to grant service access to additional AWS resources when required. For this
purpose, user can set `x-aws-policies` or define a fine grained `x-aws-role` IAM role document.

Service's ports get mapped into security group's `IngressRule`s and load balancer `Listener`s.
Compose application with HTTP services only (using ports 80/443 or `x-aws-protocol` set to `http`) get an Application Load Balancer
created, otherwise a Network Load Balancer is used.

A `TargetGroup` is created per service to dispatch traffic by load balancer to the matching containers

Secrets bound to a service get translated into an `InitContainer` added to the service's `TaskDefinition`. This init container is
responsible to create a `/run/secrets` file for secret to match docker secret model and make application code portable.
A `TaskExecutionRole` is also created per service, and is updated to grant access to bound secrets.

Services using a GPU (`DeviceRequest`) get the `Cluster` extended with an EC2 `CapacityProvider`, using an `AutoscalingGroup` to manage
EC2 resources allocation based on a `LaunchConfiguration`. The latter uses ECS recommended AMI and machine type for GPU.

Service to declare `deploy.x-aws-autoscaling` get a `ScalingPolicy` created targeting specified the configured CPU usage metric
